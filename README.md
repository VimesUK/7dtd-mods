This is a collection of very basic mods that I used to always apply by hand. Thanks to the awesome new xpath modlet system, I no longer need to do that!

## Mod Info

Don't use 2 of the same mods such as `AugerMod` and `AugerPlusNoKickMod`. Using similiar mods won't do what you think it will do......

### AugerMod

Makes the auger one shot stone after you get some strength and/or miner69 perks. Increases wood damage so you can 1-2 shot trees. Also increases the gas tank to a reasonable size.

### AugerPlusNoKickMod

Same as `AugerMod` just that kick is removed.

### TripleThreatPointMod

3 points for perks per level.

### StackSizeMod

Stack size changes/remaps the following:

- 1000 -> 10,000 (i.e. gas cans)
- 6000 -> 10,000 (i.e. wood stacks)
- iron frags -> 10,000
